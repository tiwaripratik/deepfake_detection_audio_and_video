# deepfake_detection_audio_and_video
This project aims to detect deepfake videos using state-of-the-art techniques such as MTCNN  for face detection and ResNet  for deep learning-based analysis. And   a deepfake detection system for audio content, focusing on identifying manipulated or synthetic audio files created through deep learning techniques.
